# Welcome

This [site](https://afmiddleton.github.io/home-automation-pages/) documents my efforts, trials, tribulations, muses and hopefully some successes in Home Automation.

## To date

When we were lucky enough to buy our house in Nov 2011 we needed to modernise and in some case renovate it. Part of this effort was also to turn it into a 'smart house'.

Having had 5+ years of living in rented accomodation and being limited by the temporary changes I could make knowing we had to restore it to 'as was' and having a stock pile of 'this will be useful one day' eBay purchases I rather gleefully set about adding basic automations for lighting, curtain control, telephonics, audio visual, both whole house and cinematics for the living room, and later heating (a number of times!). The outcome was very much work in progress, marshalled by a number of home controllers roughly coupled together with MQTT, Alexa and a decoupled CBus Wiser control system. Frankly it was exciting work in progress that I'd spend evenings tweaking and weeks debugging.

And then the kids arrived...

And then stuff stopped working...

## Objectives

Provide a smart home that;

- automates basic functionality for time of day, occupency and presence.
- allows additional intuative 'on demand' control
- adds fun and simplification of our daily lives

## Delivery

As the kids have grown a little older and I have a little time for projects I'll document my progress, share my projects and put in place some reminder of how I configured things in case child number 3 arrives.
